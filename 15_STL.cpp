/*
- The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library
  of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized.
- STL provides a way to write generic, reusable code that can be applied to different data types.
- STL has the following important components:
    a) Algorithms: The STL provides a range of algorithms, such as sort, find, and binary_search, which can be used to manipulate data stored in containers.
    b) Containers: The STL provides a range of containers, such as vector, list, map, set, and stack, which can be used to store and manipulate data.
    c) Iterators:  These are objects that provide a way to traverse the elements of a container.
    d) Functors: Function objects, also known as functors, are objects that can be used as function arguments to algorithms. They provide a way to pass a function to an algorithm,
                 allowing to customize its behavior.
    e) Adapters: Adapters are components that modify the behavior of other components in the STL. For example, the reverse_iterator adapter can be used to reverse the order of elements
                 in a container.
- The header algorithm defines a collection of functions specially designed to be used on a range of elements. They act on containers and provide means for various operations for the
  contents of the containers.
- Containers or container classes store objects and data. There are in total seven standards “first-class” container classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven header
  files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors.
- Sequence Containers implement data structures that can be accessed in a sequential manner. These are: vectors, list, deque, arrays and forward_list.
- Container Adaptors provide a different interface for sequential containters. There are: queue, priority queue, and stack.
- Associative Containers implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity). These are: set, multiset, map, and multimap.
- Unordered Containers implement unordered data structures that can be quickly searched. These are: unordered_set, unordered_multiset, unordered_map, and unordered_multimap.
